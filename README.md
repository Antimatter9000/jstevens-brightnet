### Bright Network evaluation

App has been deployed to [https://lab.jstevens.digital/jstevens-brightnet](https://lab.jstevens.digital/jstevens-brightnet)

If you wish to run the code locally, you can do so by cloning the repo then `npm install && npm run dev`

**PLEASE NOTE:** If running locally, you may get unexpected results unless you comment out the script tag in index.html - this is required for the deployment but may conflict with the in memory bundle generated by Webpack Dev Server.
